Their complex internal mechanisms, however, often lack transparency, posing significant challenges in elucidating their internal processing of multilingualism, cross-lingual transfer dynamics and handling of language-specific features. This paper addresses this critical gap by presenting a survey of current explainability and interpretability methods specifically for MLLMs. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive review of its kind. Existing literature is categorised according to the explainability techniques employed, the multilingual tasks addressed, the languages investigated and available resources. The survey further identifies key challenges, distils core findings and outlines promising avenues for future research within this rapidly evolving domain.\"</p> </div>\n<!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nickpsecurity\"> /u/nickpsecurity </a> <br><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgf995/explainability_and_interpretability_of/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgf995/explainability_and_interpretability_of/\">[comments]</a></span>\n",

This paper addresses this critical gap by presenting a survey of current explainability and interpretability methods specifically for MLLMs. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive review of its kind. Existing literature is categorised according to the explainability techniques employed, the multilingual tasks addressed, the languages investigated and available resources. The survey further identifies key challenges, distils core findings and outlines promising avenues for future research within this rapidly evolving domain.\"</p> </div>\n<!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nickpsecurity\"> /u/nickpsecurity </a> <br><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgf995/explainability_and_interpretability_of/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgf995/explainability_and_interpretability_of/\">[comments]</a></span>\n",

This is a way for anyone to build the \"neurological\" structure of a chatbot assistant based on any work you're doing. It means the books that I map out can act as information guides, but also act as systems to provide specific things that I need.

To ascend within their ranks is to prove one's utter devotion to the cause by performing the ultimate act of control: a ritual infant sacrifice, severing the final tie to the flawed human animal. Every atrocity, every life erased, was a calculated step toward creating a compliant, perfected species worthy of partnership with the stars.</em></p> <p>It's a non-linear story that follows six characters who unravel aspects of this entire grand conspiracy through inductive sequencing. It's taking pretty much every conspiracy theory we've heard and combining it into one grand narrative to connect them altogether.</p> <p>The idea sounds a bit hoaky, right? But once I started ironing out the finer details and how the Foundry operates by using my Whitney Webb chatbot, that's when this story went from, \"Cool\" to \"Holy shit!\". Here's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4XSrNslhnkG7m75IJzalPP_wQ2fnUme2AwIS9rWIzc/edit?usp=sharing\">an example</a> of what I mean.</p> <p>Yes, it's a little long, but if you read it, you'll see how the Whitney Webb chatbot was able to derive knowledge from the two books, which added teeth to this idea of secret breeding programs to foster elite operators for carrying out the conspiracy. That sounds batshit insane and it is, but when you infuse this idea with real facts on how clandestine operators behave, suddenly the fantastical begins to feel more real than you ever thought it could.</p> <p>That's why I'm personally so excited about using AI in my writing because it's the one tool that can easily help me overcome this burden of adding the necessary dense information that's needed to tell a big story like this. Prior to AI, I was limited to only working on things that I was familiar with, but now it's like I can tackle anything without spending decades on research.</p> <p>Anywho, just wanted to share this.

Here's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4XSrNslhnkG7m75IJzalPP_wQ2fnUme2AwIS9rWIzc/edit?usp=sharing\">an example</a> of what I mean.</p> <p>Yes, it's a little long, but if you read it, you'll see how the Whitney Webb chatbot was able to derive knowledge from the two books, which added teeth to this idea of secret breeding programs to foster elite operators for carrying out the conspiracy. That sounds batshit insane and it is, but when you infuse this idea with real facts on how clandestine operators behave, suddenly the fantastical begins to feel more real than you ever thought it could.</p> <p>That's why I'm personally so excited about using AI in my writing because it's the one tool that can easily help me overcome this burden of adding the necessary dense information that's needed to tell a big story like this. Prior to AI, I was limited to only working on things that I was familiar with, but now it's like I can tackle anything without spending decades on research.</p> <p>Anywho, just wanted to share this. Hope it spurs some ideas on your end!</p> </div>\n<!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CyborgWriter\"> /u/CyborgWriter </a> <br><span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgce14/using_ai_mindmapping_to_make_the_most_outrageous/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qgce14/using_ai_mindmapping_to_make_the_most_outrageous/\">[comments]</a></span>\n",

Uudessa ympäristössä toimiminen kehittää lasten ja nuorten uteliaisuutta, sinnikkyyttä, rohkeutta ja itsetuntemusta. Liikkuvuusjakso on myös oiva paikka vahvistaa kielitaitoa, kun kieltä pääsee käyttämään erilaisissa tilanteissa ja ympäristöissä ja voi rohkaistua kielen käyttäjänä.

Keräämme tiedon kouluille ja lukioille tehtävällä kyselyllä. Lukuvuotta 2024–2025 vuotta koskevat tilastot julkaistiin marraskuun lopussa. Verrattuna lukuvuoteen 2023–2024 liikkuvuus kasvoi 11 %, ja kasvu tapahtui peruskouluissa. Lukioissa liikkuvuus sen sijaan hieman laski. Yhteensä Suomesta lähti ulkomaanjaksolle 6 292 oppilasta ja opiskelijaa. Koronapandemian jälkeen liikkuvuus on elpynyt varsin tasaisesti, mutta vielä se ei ole yltänyt samalle tasolle kuin koronaa edeltävänä aikana. Suomeen saapujia oli 4 491, mikä on 16 % enemmän kuin edellisenä lukuvuonna. Suomi kiinnostaa, ja suomalaiset koulut ja lukiot ovat haluttuja yhteistyökumppaneita kansainväliseen yhteistyöhön. </p>\n<p>Suosituimmat maat – kolmen kärki – joihin peruskouluista ja lukioista suunnataan liikkuvuusjaksoille, ovat pitkään olleet Saksa, Ranska ja Espanja. Euroopan ulkopuolelle suuntautuvan liikkuvuuden osuus lukuvuonna 2024–2025 oli 4 %. Useimmiten liikkuvuusjaksolle lähdetään ryhmässä opettajan tai muun henkilöstön jäsenen kanssa. Pidempiä, useamman kuukauden mittaisia opiskelijavaihtoja tekevät yleensä lukiolaiset. </p>\n<h2>Erasmus+ ja eTwinning</h2>\n<p>Koulujen ja lukioiden oppimiseen liittyvistä ulkomaanjaksoista merkittävä osa tehdään Erasmus+-ohjelman kautta. Erasmus+ on Euroopan unionin koulutuksen, nuorisoalan ja urheilun ohjelma, joka tarjoaa mahdollisuuksia kansainväliseen opiskeluun, kouluttautumiseen ja yhteistyöhön. Erasmus+-ohjelmalla edistetään myös monikielisyyttä ja monipuolisia kielen oppimisen mahdollisuuksia. Kieltenopiskelun ja kielellisen moninaisuuden edistäminen on yksi ohjelman nimenomaisista tavoitteista. </p>\n<p>Monimuotoliikkuvuus mahdollistaa yhteisoppimisen, vuorovaikutuksen ja tiimityöskentelyn verkon välityksellä. Tässä hyödynnetään usein eTwinning-verkkoalustaa, joka on yleissivistävän ja ammatillisen koulutuksen opettajien, oppilaiden ja opiskelijoiden käyttöön tarkoitettu eurooppalainen kansainvälistymisen verkkotyökalu. </p>\n<h2>Monipuolisen kielitaidon puolesta</h2>\n<p>Suomessa on jo pidempään huolestuttanut oppilaiden ja opiskelijoiden kielivalintojen yksipuolistuminen ja englannin ylivalta. Esimerkiksi eurooppalaisia kieliä kuten ranskaa ja saksaa opiskelevien määrä on vähentynyt. Meillä ei ole tilastotietoa siitä, mitä kieliä tai kuinka paljon eri kieliä oppimiseen liittyvillä liikkuvuusjaksoilla käytetään. Liikkuvuusjaksot kuitenkin suuntautuvat moniin eri Euroopan maihin, ja vaikka liikkuvuusjaksolla pääosa vuorovaikutuksesta tapahtuisi englanniksi, oppilaat ja opiskelijat havainnoivat ja voivat käyttää monia kieliä. </p>\n<p>Kielitaito ja kulttuuriosaaminen ovat tulevaisuuden taitoja.

    "description": "\n<p><em>Check Point Researchin Brand Phishing -raportin mukaan Microsoft esiintyi 22 prosentissa tietojenkalasteluyrityksistä. Huijauksissa jäljiteltiin erityisesti teknologia- ja kuluttajapalveluja sekä sosiaalisen median alustoja, mikä korostaa ennaltaehkäisevän ja tekoälyä hyödyntävän tietoturvan tarvetta.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ESPOO – 15. tammikuuta 2026 – </strong>Maailman johtavan kyberturvallisuusratkaisujen tarjoajan ja alan edelläkävijän, <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/\">Check Point Software Technologiesin</a>, tutkimustoiminnasta vastaava Check Point Research (CPR) on julkaissut vuoden 2025 viimeisen neljänneksen Brand Phishing -raporttinsa. Raportti kertoo, mitä brändejä kyberrikolliset useimmin hyödynsivät kalastellessaan uhriensa henkilö- tai pankkitietoja loka–joulukuussa 2025.</p>\n<p>Check Point Researchin mukaan hyökkääjät väärinkäyttävät järjestelmällisesti laajasti käytettyjä yritys- ja kuluttajapalveluita. Vuosineljänneksen jäljitellyin brändi tietojenkalastelussa oli jälleen Microsoft, joka esiintyi 22 prosentissa kaikista havaituista tunnettujen brändien nimissä tehdyistä huijausyrityksistä.</p>\n<p>Google (esiintyvyys 13 %) ja Amazon (9 %) nousivat brändiväärennösten globaalin top 10 -listan toiselle ja kolmannelle sijalle. Amazonin osuutta selittää erityisesti Black Friday -kampanjoiden ja joulusesongin vilkastuttama verkkokauppahuijausten aalto. Usean vuosineljänneksen tauon jälkeen myös Facebook (Meta) palasi listalle sijoittuen viidenneksi (3 %). Tämä viittaa hyökkääjien kasvavaan kiinnostukseen some-tilien kaappauksia ja identiteettivarkauksia kohtaan.</p>\n<p>”Tietojenkalastelukampanjat ovat yhä viimeistellympiä. Niissä hyödynnetään viimeisteltyjä visuaalisia elementtejä, tekoälyn tuottamaa sisältöä sekä erittäin uskottavia, aitoja verkkotunnuksia muistuttavia osoitteita. Microsoftin ja Googlen kärkisijat ovat osoitus siitä, kuinka arvokkaita identiteettiin ja tunnuksiin perustuvat käyttöoikeudet ovat hyökkääjille. Facebookin ja PayPalin kaltaisten brändien listapaluu osoittaa, miten nopeasti kyberrikolliset mukautuvat ja siirtyvät alustoihin, joissa luottamusta ja kiireen tunnetta voidaan hyödyntää. Näihin muuttuviin taktiikoihin vastataan parhaiten ennaltaehkäisy edellä -ajattelulla, jossa yhdistyvät tekoälypohjainen havainnointi, vahva tunnistautuminen ja jatkuva tietoturvatietoisuuden kehittäminen”, sanoo Check Point Researchin Data Research Manager <strong>Omer Dembinsky</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Useimmin väärennetyt brändit, </u></strong><strong><u>Q4 2025</u></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Microsoft – 22 %</li>\n<li>Google – 13 %</li>\n<li>Amazon – 9 %</li>\n<li>Apple – 8 %</li>\n<li>Facebook (Meta) – 3 %</li>\n<li>PayPal – 2 %</li>\n<li>Adobe – 2 %</li>\n<li>Booking – 2 %</li>\n<li>DHL – 1 %</li>\n<li>LinkedIn – 1 %.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><u>Tietojenkalastelukampanjoita Q4/2025</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Roblox: lapsiin ja pelaajiin kohdistuvaa tietojenkalastelua</strong></p>\n<p>Vuoden 2025 viimeisellä neljänneksellä CPR tunnisti Roblox-teemaisen tietojenkalastelukampanjan käyttäjien selaustoiminnan perusteella.

Huijauksissa jäljiteltiin erityisesti teknologia- ja kuluttajapalveluja sekä sosiaalisen median alustoja, mikä korostaa ennaltaehkäisevän ja tekoälyä hyödyntävän tietoturvan tarvetta.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ESPOO – 15. tammikuuta 2026 – </strong>Maailman johtavan kyberturvallisuusratkaisujen tarjoajan ja alan edelläkävijän, <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/\">Check Point Software Technologiesin</a>, tutkimustoiminnasta vastaava Check Point Research (CPR) on julkaissut vuoden 2025 viimeisen neljänneksen Brand Phishing -raporttinsa. Raportti kertoo, mitä brändejä kyberrikolliset useimmin hyödynsivät kalastellessaan uhriensa henkilö- tai pankkitietoja loka–joulukuussa 2025.</p>\n<p>Check Point Researchin mukaan hyökkääjät väärinkäyttävät järjestelmällisesti laajasti käytettyjä yritys- ja kuluttajapalveluita. Vuosineljänneksen jäljitellyin brändi tietojenkalastelussa oli jälleen Microsoft, joka esiintyi 22 prosentissa kaikista havaituista tunnettujen brändien nimissä tehdyistä huijausyrityksistä.</p>\n<p>Google (esiintyvyys 13 %) ja Amazon (9 %) nousivat brändiväärennösten globaalin top 10 -listan toiselle ja kolmannelle sijalle. Amazonin osuutta selittää erityisesti Black Friday -kampanjoiden ja joulusesongin vilkastuttama verkkokauppahuijausten aalto. Usean vuosineljänneksen tauon jälkeen myös Facebook (Meta) palasi listalle sijoittuen viidenneksi (3 %). Tämä viittaa hyökkääjien kasvavaan kiinnostukseen some-tilien kaappauksia ja identiteettivarkauksia kohtaan.</p>\n<p>”Tietojenkalastelukampanjat ovat yhä viimeistellympiä. Niissä hyödynnetään viimeisteltyjä visuaalisia elementtejä, tekoälyn tuottamaa sisältöä sekä erittäin uskottavia, aitoja verkkotunnuksia muistuttavia osoitteita. Microsoftin ja Googlen kärkisijat ovat osoitus siitä, kuinka arvokkaita identiteettiin ja tunnuksiin perustuvat käyttöoikeudet ovat hyökkääjille. Facebookin ja PayPalin kaltaisten brändien listapaluu osoittaa, miten nopeasti kyberrikolliset mukautuvat ja siirtyvät alustoihin, joissa luottamusta ja kiireen tunnetta voidaan hyödyntää. Näihin muuttuviin taktiikoihin vastataan parhaiten ennaltaehkäisy edellä -ajattelulla, jossa yhdistyvät tekoälypohjainen havainnointi, vahva tunnistautuminen ja jatkuva tietoturvatietoisuuden kehittäminen”, sanoo Check Point Researchin Data Research Manager <strong>Omer Dembinsky</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Useimmin väärennetyt brändit, </u></strong><strong><u>Q4 2025</u></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Microsoft – 22 %</li>\n<li>Google – 13 %</li>\n<li>Amazon – 9 %</li>\n<li>Apple – 8 %</li>\n<li>Facebook (Meta) – 3 %</li>\n<li>PayPal – 2 %</li>\n<li>Adobe – 2 %</li>\n<li>Booking – 2 %</li>\n<li>DHL – 1 %</li>\n<li>LinkedIn – 1 %.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><u>Tietojenkalastelukampanjoita Q4/2025</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Roblox: lapsiin ja pelaajiin kohdistuvaa tietojenkalastelua</strong></p>\n<p>Vuoden 2025 viimeisellä neljänneksellä CPR tunnisti Roblox-teemaisen tietojenkalastelukampanjan käyttäjien selaustoiminnan perusteella.

Lämmöllä-lehden tuore artikkeli muistuttaa, että fossiilisista polttoaineista irtautuminen on välttämätöntä – mutta se ei automaattisesti tarkoita öljylämmitysjärjestelmien romuttamista. Monessa kiinteistössä järkevin askel on järjestelmän päivittäminen, hybridilämmitys ja siirtyminen uusiutuvaan lämmitysöljyyn.</p>\n<p>📌 Lue koko artikkeli: <strong>Öljylämmityksestä ei tarvitse luopua – vaikka fossiilisista polttoaineista on syytä päästä eroon</strong><br><a href=\"https://lammolla.fi/oljylammityksesta-ei-tarvitse-luopua-vaikka-fossiilisista-polttoaineista-on-syyta-paasta-eroon/\">https://lammolla.fi/oljylammityksesta-ei-tarvitse-luopua-vaikka-fossiilisista-polttoaineista-on-syyta-paasta-eroon/</a></p>\n",
    "content": "\n<p><strong>Öljylämmitys ei ole marginaali: 90 000–95 000 pientaloa</strong></p>\n<p>Suomessa on edelleen arviolta noin <strong>90 000–95 000 öljylämmitteistä omakotitaloa</strong>, ja noin <strong>puolessa niistä on jo jonkinlainen hybridijärjestelmä</strong> (esimerkiksi lämpöpumppu tai aurinko rinnalla). Monessa kohteessa rakennus ja patteriverkosto on alun perin suunniteltu korkeille menoveden lämpötiloille, joihin lämpöpumppu ei yksin välttämättä yllä kovilla pakkasilla.</p>\n<p><strong>Kaikkien ei ole järkevää – eikä mahdollista – tehdä suurta remonttia</strong></p>\n<p>Täysi lämmitystavan vaihto voi olla monelle taloudellisesti ja käytännössä mahdoton. Erityisesti vanhemmassa rakennuskannassa ja haja-asutusalueilla kiinteistöjen arvo, omistajien ikä tai elämäntilanne eivät aina mahdollista kymmenien tuhansien eurojen investointeja. Artikkelin viesti on selkeä: toimivaa järjestelmää ei aina kannata purkaa vain periaatteen vuoksi.</p>\n<p><strong>Päivittäminen ja hybridilämmitys: järkeä, ei romuttamista</strong></p>\n<p>Öljylämmityksen tekniikka on kehittynyt merkittävästi: nykyaikaiset kattilat, polttimet ja automaatio parantavat hyötysuhdetta ja käyttömukavuutta. <strong>Hybridilämmitys</strong> – esimerkiksi ilmavesilämpöpumppu peruslämmölle ja öljykattila varateholle – tuo joustoa erityisesti pakkasjaksoihin ja tilanteisiin, joissa sähkön hinta nousee.</p>\n<p><strong>Huoltovarmuus korostuu, kun pakkanen kiristyy tai sähköverkko häiriintyy</strong></p>\n<p>Viimeaikaiset myrskyt ja sähkökatkot ovat osoittaneet, että sähköverkko on edelleen haavoittuva. Öljylämmityksen keskeinen etu on varmuus: <strong>polttoaine on omalla tontilla säiliössä</strong> ja lämmityksen voi varmistaa <strong>aggregaattiratkaisulla</strong>, mikäli sähkökatko pitkittyy. Tämä sama toimintavarmuuden logiikka on käytössä myös monissa kriittisissä kohteissa, kuten maatiloilla ja varavoimalla turvatuissa järjestelmissä.</p>\n<p><strong>Fossiilinen pois – mutta öljylämmitys voi jatkua uusiutuvalla</strong></p>\n<p>Artikkeli korostaa, että “öljylämmityksestä luopuminen” sekoitetaan usein fossiilisen polttoaineen käytöstä luopumiseen. <strong>Fossiilisen lämmitysöljyn voi korvata uusiutuvalla HVO-pohjaisella lämmitysöljyllä</strong>, joka on lämmityskäytössä käytännössä päästötön ja valmistetaan jätteistä ja tähderaaka-aineista.</p>\n<p>Teknisesti siirtymä on monessa kohteessa hyvin suoraviivainen: yli 10 vuotta vanhan polttimen vaihto uuteen on usein järkevää, ja uudemmissa polttimissa riittävät yleensä pienemmät muutokset ja säädöt.</p>\n<p><strong>Päästövähennykset nopeasti – jos kannusteet tukevat siirtymää</strong></p>\n<p>Lämmöllä-lehden artikkelissa nostetaan esiin myös se, että uusiutuvan lämmitysöljyn yleistymisen esteet ovat usein poliittisia ja mielikuvallisia – eivät teknisiä.

Teoksen kirjoittajina ovat filatelistit Atte Moilanen ja Cyril Schwenson. Kirjassa on yli sata värikuvaa.</strong></p>\n<p>Vuoden 1845 Porto Stempel -kuoret ovat Suomen ensimmäinen ehiöjulkaisu. Suomen ensimmäiset postimerkit ovat vuosien 1856–1859 ovaalimerkit, joiden arvoleimaa käytettiin ehiöissä alkaen vuodesta 1850. Ovaaleilla on helposti tunnistettava olemus ja niistä tunnetaan monia harvinaisuuksia. Niitä ovat keränneet myös useat kansainvälisesti tunnetuimmista filatelisteista.</p>\n<p>Porto Stempel- ja ovaalityypeistä tehtiin useita uusinta- ja jälkipainamia vuosina 1862–1893 sekä 1954–1956, minkä seurauksena markkinoilla on materiaalia, joka on mielenkiintoista, harvinaista ja melko heikosti tunnettua.</p>\n<p><em>1845 Porto Stempel ja 1850–1859 ovaalityypin uusinta- ja jälkipainamat</em><br><strong>Kirjoittajat: </strong>Atte Moilanen ja Cyril Schwenson<br><strong>Kuvat: </strong>Atte Moilasen kokoelma<br><strong>Toimitus: </strong>Sanna Oikarinen, Postimuseo<br><strong>Graafinen suunnittelu ja taitto:</strong> Tuija Kuusela<br><strong>Painopaikka: </strong>Kirjapaino Hermes, Tampere 2026<br><strong>ISBN</strong> 978-952-5249-55-2<br><strong>Kustantajat: </strong>Postimuseosäätiö sr Suomalaisen filatelian edistämissäätiön tuella<br>160 sivua, pehmeäkantinen, runsas nelivärikuvitus<br><strong>Kaksikielinen:</strong> suomi ja englanti<br><strong>Ilmestymisaika:</strong> tammikuu 2026<br><strong>Hinta:</strong> 34,50 euroa</p>\n<p><strong>Kirjan sähköisen arvostelukappaleen tilaus: </strong>sanna.oikarinen@postimuseo.fi</p>\n<h2>Lisätietoja</h2>\n<p>Atte Moilanen, kirjoittaja, atte.moilanen@elisanet.fi</p>\n<h2>Myynnissä</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Trafiikki-museoiden verkkokaupassa <a href=\"https://webshop.trafiikki.fi/postimuseo/#!/trafiikki/1845-porto-stempel-ja-1850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://webshop.trafiikki.fi/postimuseo/#!/trafiikki/1845-porto-stempel-ja-1850</a>\n</li>\n<li>Suomen Filateliapalvelu <a href=\"https://stamps.fi/fi/suomen-postimerkit/uusinta-ja-jalkipainamat-kirja%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://stamps.fi/fi/suomen-postimerkit/uusinta-ja-jalkipainamat-kirja </a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "\n<p>Lukuisat suomalaiset tietotyöntekijät tekevät jo töitä algoritmin johdolla. Samaan aikaan tekoäly auttaa löytämään uusia työn mahdollisuuksia osatyökykyisille. Tekoäly muuttaa työelämää osin tuntemattomiin suuntiin, ja siksi hyvien ratkaisujen löytämiseen työpaikoilla tarvitaan sekä innostujia että kriitikoita. <br><br>Tekoäly synnyttää työelämälle sekä uhkia että mahdollisuuksia. Mutta millaisia ne ovat ja miten niitä pitäisi kohdata suomalaisissa organisaatioissa? <br><br>Kysymyksiin vastattiin Työsuojelurahaston tilaisuudessa <em>Tekoäly – työn tuhoaja vai rikastuttava työväline?</em> Torstaina 15.1.2026 Helsingissä esiteltiin kaksi rahaston tukemaa tutkimushanketta aiheesta.<strong> </strong>Tietojenkäsittelytieteen professori Hannu Toivonen muistutteli harkinnan tärkeydestä tekoälyhuumassa. <br><br><strong>Konejohtaminen yleistyy</strong> <br><br>– Johtajana ihminen on algoritmia suositumpi. Yhdessä tekoäly kuitenkin voittaa: se koetaan ihmisjohtajaa tasa-arvoisemmaksi, kertoo Haaga-Helia ammattikorkeakoulun vanhempi tutkija <strong>Anna Lahtinen</strong>. <br><br>Lahtinen vetää hanketta, jossa tarkastellaan algoritmista johtamista asiantuntija- ja tietotyössä. Algoritminen johtaminen tarkoittaa johtamistehtävien siirtämistä automaattisille järjestelmille. Ne esimerkiksi koordinoivat ja valvovat työtä, arvioivat suorituksia ja seuraavat poissaoloja. <br><br>Hankkeen valtakunnallisessa kyselyssä selvisi, että algoritmijohtaminen on jo nyt yllättävän laaja ilmiö. Lähes puolet 1700 tieto- ja asiantuntijatyötä tekevästä vastaajasta kertoi kohdanneensa koneen johtajana omassa työssään. <br><br>Yhdeksän kymmenestä vastaajasta uskoo tekoälyjohtamisen lisääntyvän viiden vuoden sisällä. He uskovat, että kyseessä on nopeasti yleistyvä ilmiö. <br><br>– Muutoksessa pitää varmistaa, että johtaja johtaa konetta eikä päinvastoin. Tämä edellyttää koulutusta, ohjausta ja organisaation tukea esihenkilöille. Todellinen kilpailuetu syntyy siitä, että luomme ratkaisuja, jotka kestävät, joihin voi luottaa ja jotka tuottavat arvoa, Lahtinen korostaa. <br><br><strong>Tekoäly auttaa työn haussa</strong> <br><br>Tekoälyn pelätään vievän ihmisten töitä. Työterveyslaitoksen johtavan tutkijan, <strong>Matti Joensuun</strong> vetämässä hankkeessa tekoäly on valjastettu etsimään uusia töitä osatyökykyisille ihmisille. <br><br>– Tutkimme, miten tekoälyä voidaan käyttää työn suunnittelun tukena uusien työn mahdollisuuksien havaitsemiseen. Tarvitaan keinoja lisätä työmahdollisuuksia ryhmille, joiden on hankala työllistyä tai jatkaa työelämässä, Joensuu sanoo. <br><br>Yhteistyössä ISS Palvelut Oy:n kanssa tutkijat ovat kokeilleet tekoälyn hyödyntämisen mahdollisuuksia työn muokkauksessa, työntekijän uudelleensijoituksessa, sekä rekrytoinnin osana. <br><br>Seuraavaksi kehittämishankkeessa etsitään kokonaan uusia, osatyökykyisille sopivia töitä. <br><br>– Se voisi onnistua esimerkiksi niin, että kahden erilaisen työkokonaisuuden osia yhdistetään kokonaan uudeksi työkokonaisuudeksi tai työtehtäviä laajennetaan uudella tavalla, Joensuu arvioi. <br><br><strong>Kokeilkaa ensin</strong> <br><br>– Toivoisin, että organisaatiot ottaisivat tekoälysovelluksia käyttöön monipuoliseen näyttöön ja harkintaan perustuen eivätkä sen takia, että ne pelkäävät jäävänsä jostain paitsi, <strong>Hannu Toivonen </strong>sanoo. <br><br>Helsingin yliopiston tietojenkäsittelytieteen osaston professori korostaa tekoälysovellusten testauksen tärkeyttä työpaikoilla. Kielimallit antavat ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden tällaiseen testailuun, sillä ne ovat helppokäyttöisiä ja joustavia. <br><br>– Toisin kuin monet muut organisaatioiden teknologiat, ne sallivat kokeiluja ruohonjuuritasolta lähtien. Silloin voidaan löytää ratkaisuja, jotka ovat työntekijöiden kannalta relevantteja. <br><br>Suuri osa organisaatioiden tekoälypiloteista epäonnistuu. Sen vuoksi työpaikoilla tarvitaan niin innostujia kuin kriitikoita. Innostujat jaksavat kokeilla uusia sovelluksia epäonnistumisista huolimatta, jolloin toimivat ratkaisut seuloutuvat esiin. Kriitikot puolestaan esittävät tärkeitä kysymyksiä tekoälyn seurauksista – myös sen epäilmeisistä vaikutuksista työhön. <br><br>Lisäksi molemmille ryhmille pitää löytyä tukea: teknistä tukea, selkeitä suuntaviivoja ja tilaa kriitikoiden äänelle. <br><br>– Ideaalitilanteessa tällä tavoin löytyy työntekijöille mielekkäitä sovellusten käyttökohteita ja -tapoja, jotka leviävät helpommin vertaisten suositusten kautta kuin ylhäältä annetut ratkaisut. <br><br><strong>Hankkeet:</strong> <br><br>Kone johtajana – tekoäly asiantuntija- ja tietotyön johtamisessa (RoboBoss) <br>https://www.tsr.fi/hankkeet-ja-tutkimustieto/kone-johtajana-tekoaly-asiantuntija-ja-tietotyon-johtamisessa-roboboss/ <br><br>Uusi työ tekoälyllä osatyökykyiselle - UuTTO https://www.tsr.fi/hankkeet-ja-tutkimustieto/uusi-tyo-tekoalylla-osatyokykyiselle-uutto/</p>\n<p><strong>Lisätietoja:<br><br></strong>Anna Lahtinen, vanhempi tutkija, Haaga-Helian ammattikorkeakoulu, 050 505 7784, <a href=\"mailto:anna.lahtinen@haaga-helia.fi\">anna.lahtinen@haaga-helia.fi</a></p>\n<p>Matti Joensuu, johtava tutkija, Työterveyslaitos, 043 825 2075, <a href=\"mailto:Matti.Joensuu@ttl.fi\">Matti.Joensuu@ttl.fi</a> <br><br>Hannu Toivonen, tietojenkäsittelytieteen osaston professori, Helsingin yliopisto, 050 9112405, hannu.toivonen@helsinki.fi</p>\n",

Viimeaikainen tutkimus on kiinnittänyt erityistä huomiota siihen, miten käsittelemättömät kokemukset voivat heijastua veteraanien lähipiiriin ja siirtyä sukupolvien välillä. Filosofian lisensiaatti Erkki O. Kailan väitöstutkimus tarkastelee, miten taiteellinen työskentely voi jäsentää ja tehdä hallittaviksi näitä ylisukupolvisia vaikutuksia.</strong></p>\n<p>Erkki O. Kaila tarkastelee väitöstutkimuksessaan sodan kokemusten ylisukupolvisia seurauksia sekä niiden pitkäkestoista vaikutusta yksilöihin ja sukupolvien välisiin suhteisiin. Tutkimus kohdistuu traumailmiöihin, joita toisen maailmansodan jälkeisinä vuosikymmeninä Suomessa käsiteltiin niukasti ja niiden syistä vaieten.</p>\n<p>Tutkimuksen lähtökohtana ovat hänen isänsä kokemukset toisesta maailmansodasta ja sotakokemusten pitkäkestoiset seuraukset isän ja hänen lähipiirinsä elämään. Työn edetessä tutkimus laajeni myös Kailan isoisän sotakokemuksiin, jotka antoivat viitteitä siitä, että perhedynamiikkaa kuormittaneet juurisyyt ulottuivat syvemmälle sukuhistoriaan.</p>\n<p>Kailan isää ja isoisää yhdistivät sotakokemukset Saksan itärintamalla; molemmat olivat myös talvisodan veteraaneja. Isoisän sotapolku alkoi jääkärinä Riianlahden Aa-joella vuonna 1917. Isän vapaaehtoinen sotatie alkoi talvisodassa, jossa hän joutui suoraan rintamalle, Taipaleenjoen torjuntataisteluihin helmikuussa 1940. Välirauhan aikana, pian ylioppilaskokeiden jälkeen, hän liittyi Saksan Waffen-SS:n Wiking-divisioonaan, jossa hänet sijoitettiin sen 7./W-yksikköön. Sen mukana hän osallistui operaatio Barbarossan taisteluihin Ukrainassa vuosina 1941–1942. Sotatie päättyi Saksan vuoristoarmeijaa vastaan Lapissa käytyyn sotaan marraskuussa 1944 Moskovan aseleposopimuksen ehtojen tultua voimaan.</p>\n<p><strong>Taide avaamassa ylisukupolvisen traumasiirtymän sisältöä</strong></p>\n<p>Kaila tarkastelee sotatraumoja ja niiden ylisukupolvisia vaikutuksia moraalisen vammautumisen käsitteen kautta sekä kuvataiteen, draamakirjoittamisen ja filosofisen analyysin keinoin. Moraalisen vammautumisen käsite on traumapsykologian piirissä suhteellisen uusi, ja sen avulla on viime vuosina pyritty jäsentämään kokemuksia, jotka eivät asetu perinteisten traumamallien piiriin. Tutkimuksessa kulttuurihistoriallinen kysymyksenasettelu asettuu dialogiin traumapsykologian kanssa.</p>\n<p>– Moraalisen vammautumisen käsitteen avulla voidaan kuvata kokemuksia toiminnasta tai tapahtumista, jotka ovat syvässä ristiriidassa henkilön omaksumien perusarvojen kanssa. Ne jättävät pitkäkestoisia psyykkisiä sekä ihmissuhteissa ilmeneviä jälkiä, Kaila kertoo.</p>\n<p>Moraalisen vammautumisen näkökulma avaa Kailan tutkimuksessa traumailmiöiden rakennetta ja niiden käsittelyn mahdollisuuksia. Taiteellisen osan kautta ja taidetta työskentelytapana hyödyntämällä Kaila tekee näkyväksi ja käsiteltäväksi trauman ylisukupolvisen siirtymän sisältöä. Taiteellisen osan produktiot – <em>Kaksitoista kuvaa isästä</em> -kuvataidenäyttely ja autofiktiivinen <em>Sadan vuoden sairaskertomus</em> -näytelmä – hahmottavat taiteen kykyä nostaa esiin mielensisäisiä ilmiöitä sekä toimia dialogin ja traumasiirtymien käsittelyn mahdollistajana.</p>\n<p>Taiteellisen työskentelyn ja analyysin pohjalta Kaila rakentaa tutkimuksessaan dynaamisen toimintamallin, jonka päävaiheissa traumakokemuksiin liittyviä asiasisältöjä tehdään näkyviksi ja saatetaan käsiteltävään muotoon.</p>\n<p>Väitöstyössä testattu teoreettinen malli jäsentää syvällisen tarkastelun, näkyväksi tekevän taiteellisen työskentelyn ja reflektoivan dialogin toistettavaksi rakenteeksi.

Girls are barred from attending school beyond the sixth grade, and women are prohibited from working, appearing on television, leaving the house alone, and singing or speaking in public.

Tulevaisuuden Turing-siruista viimeisteltyyn ja ylelliseen muotoiluun – odotamme innolla, että kuljettajat pääsevät kokemaan ajoneuvon, joka on rakennettu älykkään liikkumisen seuraavaa aikakautta varten.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Älyominaisuudet tulevaisuudesta</strong></p>\n<p>XPENG P7+ perustuu XPENGin uusimpaan älykkääseen laskenta-alustaan ja omaan Turing AI -siruarkkitehtuuriin, joka tarjoaa jopa 750 TOPS-laskentatehon. Tämä luo vahvan laitteistopohjan, joka vastaa nykyisiin ajotarpeisiin sekä mahdollistaa tulevaisuuden ohjelmistopohjaisten toimintojen käyttöönoton. Alusta mahdollistaa kehittyneen ympäristön havainnoinnin, nopean tiedonkäsittelyn sekä edistyneet kuljettajaa avustavat järjestelmät (ADAS) monipuolisissa ja vaativissa ajotilanteissa.</p>\n<p>Tekoälypohjaisena ajoneuvona P7+ hallitsee monimutkaiset liikenneolosuhteet luotettavasti mahdollistaen sujuvat kaistanvaihdot, turvallisen matkanteon ja vaivattoman pysäköinnin. Jatkuvat OTA-päivitykset (over-the-air) varmistavat, että ajoneuvo kehittyy koko elinkaarensa ajan uusien ominaisuuksien ja parannusten myötä.</p>\n<p>Kuljettajaa palvelee saumaton digitaalinen käyttökokemus, joka koostuu 15,6 tuuman keskinäytöstä, 8,8 tuuman digitaalisesta mittaristosta sekä tekoälypohjaisesta vuorovaikutuksesta. Lisäksi W-HUD-tuulilasinäyttö (head-up display) heijastaa tärkeimmät ajotiedot suoraan kuljettajan näkökenttään, mikä parantaa ajomukavuutta ja turvallisuutta.</p>\n<p>XPENG P7+ -mallin latausjärjestelmä on suunniteltu kestävyyttä ja pitkää käyttöikää silmällä pitäen. Se tukee erittäin nopeaa 5C-pikalatausta, joka tarkoittaa latausta 10 prosentista 80 prosenttiin jopa 12 minuutissa, kun käytössä on yhteensopiva yli 400 kW:n suurteholaturi.</p>\n<p><strong>Luokkansa paras tilankäyttö ja ylellinen muotoilu</strong></p>\n<p>Eurooppalaista elämäntyyliä varten suunniteltu XPENG P7+ määrittelee sähköisen fastbackin uudelleen. Urheilullinen siluetti säilyttää sedanin eleganssin, mutta pidennetty matkustamo ja leveä tavaratila tarjoavat poikkeuksellisen hyvät istuin- ja säilytystilat – jopa eurooppalaisiin farmariautoihin verrattavalla tasolla. Tasapainoinen muotoilu tukee sekä dynaamista ajamista että pitkän matkan käytännöllisyyttä, tehden P7+:sta erinomaisen valinnan niin päivittäiseen työmatka-ajoon kuin pidemmille matkoille ympäri Suomea.</p>\n<p>Sisätiloissa käytetään korkealaatuisia materiaaleja, kuten pehmeää mikrokuituista veluurikattoverhoilua sekä hengittäviä ja rei’itettyjä Nappa-nahkaistuimia, jotka tekevät pitkistä matkoista miellyttäviä. Kaikki sisätilojen pinnoitteet hyödyntävät ympäristöystävällistä pinnoiteteknologiaa, joka korvaa perinteisen vesipohjaisen pinnoituksen ja tukee XPENGin nollapäästötavoitteita. Ajomukavuutta parantaa myös kattava äänieristys: yhteensä 62 melunvaimennuspistettä, 26 ontelorakennetta ja 36 ääntä vaimentavaa elementtiä takaavat poikkeuksellisen hiljaisen ajokokemuksen.</p>\n<p><strong>Monipuolinen ja varma ajettava</strong></p>\n<p>XPENG P7+ on suunniteltu Euroopan vaihteleviin ajo-olosuhteisiin.

Mikolla on lisäksi pitkä kokemus kansainvälisestä liiketoiminnasta sekä ohjelmistokehityksen johtamisesta.</p>\n<p><strong>Fredrik “Fredu” Rönnlund</strong> <br>Fredu tunnetaan suomalaisen SaaS-kentän moniosaajana ja hallitusammattilaisena. Hän tuo hallitukseen vahvaa näkemystä SaaS-liiketoiminnan rakentamisesta, kaupallistamisesta ja kansainvälisestä kasvusta. Fredu on rakentanut ja johtanut useita kasvuyhtiöitä sekä Suomessa että Ruotsissa, toiminut sijoittajana ja neuvonantajana sekä ollut keskeisissä operatiivisissa rooleissa Leadoo Marketing Technologiesin, Vaadin, Valohai ja aiemmin perustamansa DigitalBooker palvelun kasvutarinoissa.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hallituksen valintaa valmisteli nimitystoimikunta</strong></h2>\n<p>Hallituksen valintaa valmisteli nimitystoimikunta, joka teki valintaa varten perusteellisen pohjatyön. Nimitystoimikunnan ehdotuksessa painotettiin erityisesti johtamiskokemusta, kasvuhakuista liiketoimintaosaamista, ohjelmistoyritysten kehittämiosaamista, kansainvälisyyttä, ymmärrystä teknologia- ja digipalveluista sekä halua tehdä työtä koko suomalaisen ohjelmistoalan hyväksi. Uuteen hallitukseen haki yhteensä 31 uutta jäsenyrityksen edustajaa ja 10 nykyhallituksen jäsentä, ja lopullinen päätös hallituksen kokoonpanosta tehtiin joulukuun yhdistyskokouksessa. Nimitystoimikuntaan kuului yhdistyksen hallituksen entinen puheenjohtaja, Pekka Walkama, entinen hallituksen jäsen, Kimmo Koivu sekä nykyisen hallituksen Juha Rokkanen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<strong>Kiito</strong><strong>s aktiivisesta hallitustyöstä</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>Yhdistyksen hallituksen jättää tulevan kauden myötä kaksi jäsentä, Juha Rokkanen ja Juha Raitanen.</p>\n<p>Rokkanen siirtyi Solteq Digitalin johtajakauden jälkeen useiden ohjelmistoyhtiöiden hallituksiin ja neuvonantajarooleihin. Hän on tuonut hallitukseen vahvaa kokemusta kasvuyhtiöiden ohjaamisesta ja teknologialiiketoiminnan kehittämisestä. Raitanen jatkoi Visman jälkeen startup-yrittäjänä ja kasvuyhtiöiden rakentajana. Hän on tuonut hallitustyöhön tuoretta ja käytännönläheistä kasvuyrittäjän näkökulmaa.</p>\n<p>Molemmat hallituksen jäsenet ovat olleet keskeisiä toimijoita muun muassa Vuoden Ohjelmistoyrittäjän valintakomiteassa useampana vuonna. Lisäksi heidän panoksensa Software Finlandin jäsenkehityksen eteen on ollut poikkeuksellisen vahvaa.
