For decades, Italian copyright law has recognised the dual nature of photography: creative photographs , protected as full copyright works for 70 years after the author’s death , and simple documentary photographs , protected only for 20 years from creation , reflecting their primarily factual func...",

    "content": "In July, MEP Axel Voss released his draft for an own initiative report on Copyright and generative AI in the JURI Committee. While the proposal was well-intentioned, in our initial reaction we were quick to criticize numerous aspects of the text, most notably its disregard for the existing legal framework, ambiguous proposals and lack of users’ rights safeguards.

One amendment to the Open Data Directive in particular could have serious consequences, potentially undermining open projects such as the Wikimedia projects. As part of its “simplification” agenda, the Commission proposes incorporating the Open Data Directive into the Data Act . In itself, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Seve...",
