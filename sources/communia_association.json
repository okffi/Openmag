    "content": "MEP Axel Voss’s own-initiative report on copyright and generative AI will be put to a vote in the JURI Committee on 28 January. Although framed as a response to legitimate questions around AI and copyright, the proposal suffers from serious shortcomings, most notably its disregard for the existing legal framework.
