This question sits at the heart of my practicum work, my broader research agenda in culturally responsive computing, and now, this proposed mapping project on Chinese multicultural motifs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project is not simply a technical exercise in web mapping, nor is it only an archive of visual patterns.

Having worked with the likes of IPC Magazines, Warner Bros., and Marvel UK for over a decade, British comics editor Derek “Dez” Skinn had had a brief flirtation with advertising design in the film and fashion industries before he decided to return to publishing. This time, he established <em>Warrior</em>, a comics anthology, published by his own company, Quality Communications, and he wanted to include a superhero strip, knowing the staying power the genre had over audiences. Instead of launching a brand new character, Skinn went back to his childhood to unearth a half-forgotten British legend created by Mick Anglo in the Superman fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter <em>Marvelman</em>.
