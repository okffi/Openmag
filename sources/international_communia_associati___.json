    "content": "Today, the JURI Committee adopted Axel Voss’s own-initiative report on copyright and generative AI . The Committee also endorsed all compromise amendments, some of which reflect concerns raised by COMMUNIA and other stakeholders. However, even with these changes, the report still contains ambiguities and problematic language that risk creating legal uncertainty, particularly for researchers and developers of public-interest AI systems. What has improved? We welcome the Committee’s decision to ad...",

Kristofer Erickson&#8217;s guest post reviews new research highlighting the the failure of Articles 6 and 7 to solve the constraints posed by technological protection measures. Open knowledge communities have contended with copyright technological protection measures (TPMs) for more than 25 years. Because their effects pers...",

    "content": "MEP Axel Voss’s own-initiative report on copyright and generative AI will be put to a vote in the JURI Committee on 28 January. Although framed as a response to legitimate questions around AI and copyright, the proposal suffers from serious shortcomings, most notably its disregard for the existing legal framework. Despite some more constructive compromise amendments , the report as a whole creates more uncertainty than it resolves. We therefore recommend its rejection. Applicability of the TDM e...",
