Integrating geospatial, temporal, and network information visualization, this project attempts to demonstrate the genealogical interconnectedness of the British elite. In doing so it expands the notion of Britishness, and the notion of society and culture in general, such that through family ties we can see George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Sigmund Freud, and Kevin Bacon all included among these kindred British. To achieve this took significant effort not only in writing code, but in envisioning how to present so much information of so many different kin</p></body></html>",

This is accomplished entirely within the browser (except for turning it into a gif) first by running cartograms for selected sites (in this case the 9 sites that are labeled by default) according to each priority, then clustering them and then drawing borders around the clusters. Notice the borders are drawn using convex hulls, and so you have overlap on border regions. It may be better (or perhaps provide an interesting alternative) to derive borders using Voronoi diagrams.</p>",
