Each provides partial insight. We offer a systems approach that focuses on whether the research is accountable, evaluable, well-formulated, has been evaluated, controls for bias, reduces error, and whether the claims are warranted by the evidence.

Because of its reliance on the external standard of the Digital Object Identifier, however, it also risks perpetuating the inequalities that already exist in this space.

This essay proposes an interpretative metaphor that frames bibliometric indicators as the “blood tests” of research systems—heuristic devices that reveal multidimensional aspects of system vitality, balance, and dysfunction. The metaphor, grounded in standard categories of clinical diagnostics (hematological, hepatic, renal, lipidic, and cardiovascular panels), provides an accessible language for scholars and policymakers in research. Each bibliometric technique—ranging from publication and citation counts to patent analysis, altmetrics, and topic modelling—is associated with a diagnost</body></html>",
