This article uses a framework analysis approach on 134 policies to investigate whether the UK RDM policies have become more open over time in terms of policy points and language. The investigation shows that recent policies have shown an increased likelihood of being more open in several areas: how long data should be archived for, sharing of software, and the mandatory inclusion of data availability statements in journal articles.

This is especially true for scholars whose performance reviews include consideration of their works’ impact in reaching interested readers. Such impact scores can include citations, amplification and readership, as tracked via altmetrics and/or other sources.\n\nThis post provides an example to illustrate why a research author should not assume that every article of theirs will be properly indexed. As result, this work may not be seen by potentially interested parties searching for pertinent work with salient keywords, despite the work's merits.\"",

In the UK and the Netherlands, for example, open research expectations are increasingly embedded in national frameworks and funding systems. The Research Excellence Framework now treats research culture as a key assessment criterion, and is further exploring the role that open research plays in this. Funders such as the UK research councils, the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy and the Dutch Science Foundation explicitly require open data, open access and evidence of good research culture in grant applications.\n\nYet these policy advances have outpaced changes in how we educate future researchers and consumers of science.

Specifically, we have trained a small, open-weight large language model (LLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on author-affiliation extraction for arXiv works. With this approach, we have for the first time produced open author-affiliation metadata for the full arXiv corpus as of December 2025, enabling community use and allowing for direct improvements to persistent identifier metadata. The trained model and dataset are openly available and free to use. Please read on to learn more!",
