Since there is evidence that LLMs can make quality predictions for journal articles that correlate more strongly with expert judgements than do citation-based indicators in most fields, they may start to supplement or replace citation-based indicators for some applications. This paper compares responsible evaluation principles from the Leiden Manifesto with those necessary for LLMs, finding them all to be still relevant.

For institutions facing intense financial pressure, price remains critical. But libraries and consortia are increasingly expected to justify not only how much they spend, but what their spending enables. As Anna Vernon noted, this includes whether agreements genuinely lower barriers to publishing, avoid reinforcing volume-driven behaviour, and support participation across institutions with very different capacities.\n\nAt the same time, the discussion grounded these ambitions in reality. As Petra Labriga emphasised, researchers still operate within career systems driven by journal prestige, impact factors, and rankings, particularly in medicine and the life sciences, where academic freedom to pu</body></html>",

As expectations around openness, transparency, and reuse continue to grow, we’ve heard a clear need for guidance.\n\nThe Open Data FAQ addresses foundational questions like what counts as “data” and what it means to publish data openly. The FAQ also tackles some thorny questions researchers regularly face: when data should&nbsp;not&nbsp;be made open, how privacy, trade secrets, patents, and copyright intersect with data sharing, and what approvals may be needed before publishing data op</body></html>",
