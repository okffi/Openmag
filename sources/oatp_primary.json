Since 2018 when Durbin helped create the Open Textbook Pilot Program, he has secured $61 million in total federal funding to support college students across the country in accessing textbooks for free and helping lower the cost of an education. Because of this funding, college students at more than 25 schools in 16 states have benefited from the Open Textbook Pilot Program.\n\n“With the rising cost of tuition, many students decline to purchase required textbooks for their coursework due to the outrageou</body></html>",

Each provides partial insight. We offer a systems approach that focuses on whether the research is accountable, evaluable, well-formulated, has been evaluated, controls for bias, reduces error, and whether the claims are warranted by the evidence.
