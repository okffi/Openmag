Using a descriptive survey design, data was collected through an online questionnaire completed by researchers across ISI’s diverse divisions. Results reveal varied data storage, security, and sharing approaches, with common challenges including inadequate version control, limited access to centralized storage, and concerns about data privacy. Findings indicate a strong reliance on self-management for RDM but highlight the need for institutional support, particularly in data documentation, secure storage options, and data-sharing protocols.

This article uses a framework analysis approach on 134 policies to investigate whether the UK RDM policies have become more open over time in terms of policy points and language. The investigation shows that recent policies have shown an increased likelihood of being more open in several areas: how long data should be archived for, sharing of software, and the mandatory inclusion of data availability statements in journal articles.
