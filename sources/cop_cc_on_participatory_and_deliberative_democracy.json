But never underestimate the importance of eating as a social and symbolic activity. During eating participants get to know each other and exchange opinions.

Their key feature is the focus on clear description of causal relations between interventions and their outcomes as well as articulation of the original state and the final outcomes to which one aspires. An interesting difference between them is the direction of thinking, either from the current si...",
