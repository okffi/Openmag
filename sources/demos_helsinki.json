Only weeks earlier, on the eve of Finland’s Independence Day, we deliberately paused to look towards future generations, helping us gain a richer and more long-term perspective on the present.

Two days ago, the European Commission published its first Affordable Housing Plan . It is encouraging to see the EU stepping more clearly into the housing space by offering policy guidance, technical support and better access to funding. While housing remains a national responsibi...",
