Participants must solve five sequential challenges to uncover the final answer.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n<b>Update:</b> the treasure hunt has been successfully solved by multiple participants, and the main prizes have now been claimed.\nBut the fun doesn’t stop here. If you still manage to find the correct final answer and go to Infodesk K, you will receive a small consolation prize as a reward for your effort.\nIf you’re still looking for a challenge, the <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/news/2025-02-01-update-treasure-hunt/\">2025</a> treasure hunt is still unsolved, so you are more than welcome to try that one instead.\nThank you to everyone who participated, and congratulation</p></body></html>",
