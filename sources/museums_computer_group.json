Thanks to many tools we are able to process more data than ever and create images and videos that are of a vastly higher quality than even a few years ago. All this is at a time when the tools to make them are currently very ‘cheap’ or even ‘free’ to use. Increasingly our online experiences are also federated through a series of algorithms: Google, Meta, TikTok. Our digital landscape is rapidly changing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet behind this as a sector we may have concerns. The output may look fantastic, but is it accurate? Are there biases going into the output which are shaping opinion? Is it properly representative? Has the so</span></p></body></html>",
