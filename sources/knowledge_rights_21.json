    "sourceDescription": "KR21 (Knowledge Rights 21) works to bring about changes in legislation and practice across Europe that will strengthen the right of all to access and apply knowledge for the benefit of research, science and society at large. This – and the education, knowledge valorisation and cultural participation it enables – are essential for innovation and development, and must be available to everyone in the information society, free of unnecessary hindrance or limitation. To achieve this, we believe that we need a modern legislative framework that places current research, education and scientific practice front and centre.",
