The event saw twenty presenters from six CUNY campuses share a wide range of exciting and innovative digital projects. The event was fully hybrid, with in-person presenters and attendees in the Graduate Center’s Skylight room, with additional participants joining us on Zoom. Using the event’s 3-slide, 3-minute format, we heard updates on the evolution of long-term projects, learned about new projects in development, and everything in between. For the first time, we had a suite of presentations examining the use of artificial intelligence in research, pedagogy, and design. The event was live-streamed at the <a href=\"https://nycpitpopup.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NYC Public Interest T</a></p></body></html>",
