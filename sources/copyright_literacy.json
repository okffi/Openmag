We often used to do a annual review at the end of each year to list out the publications we had written, the conferences we had spoken at and the research we had been involved in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we started out by reviewing the <a href=\"https://copyrightliteracy.org/copyright-literacy-strategy-2020-2025/\">Copyright Literacy Strategy that we put together in 2020.</a> Although we never formally published this document, we did refer to it over the last few years to help maintain direction and moment.

We have noted this practice has escalated and so in this closed webinar for the education community we will discuss the problems this causes and what can be done about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Register for webinar</strong></p></body></html>",
