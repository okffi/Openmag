Mapping is mainly done by professionals or machines, and this is a problem because there is so much ground information that can only be captured by local people in real-time and at scale. The ground data gap is huge, and this translates into poorly informed decision-making. To bridge this gap, mapping needs to become popular, and to popularise mapping, mapping needs to go where people are in the digital environment, i.e. in messaging apps. In a global cl...",
