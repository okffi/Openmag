The event marks the launch of an important new publication: <strong>“Safeguard Access, Empower Europe – An Action Plan to Let Libraries be Libraries.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m glad to be part of this conversation, because the issues at stake go to the very heart of what we are trying to protect through the <a href=\"https://ourfuturememory.org/\"><strong>Our Future Memory</strong></a> campaign: the ability of libraries to preserve, lend, and provide access to knowledge in the digital age — in the public interest.</p>\n\n\n\n</body></html>",
