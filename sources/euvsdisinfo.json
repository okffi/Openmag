The digital age, however, has elevated a new and potentially more dangerous instrument of influence: video games. Under the guise of entertainment, they shape worldviews and political narratives, making propaganda subtle, scalable, and effective.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unlike passive media, video games offer players not only a story but an experience in which they actively participate. As a result, ideological messages embedded in the narrative and mechanics can be internalised more deeply because they feel intrinsic to the game world. This matters given the industry’s roughly 3.3 billion players worldwide, with those aged 18-34 comprising about 38% of the audience.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Invisible persuasion in int</strong></h3></body></html>",
