It says up to 5m households could benefit from £15bn of grants and loans earmarked by the government for these upgrades by 2030. Electrified heating and energy-efficient homes are vital for the UK’s net-zero goals, but the plan also stresses that these measures will cut people’s bills by “hundreds of pounds” a year....",

However, while gas is seen in some countries as a “ bridging ” fuel to move away from coal use, rapid electrification, uncompetitiveness and supply concerns have suppressed its share in China’s energy mix. As such, while China’s gas demand has more than doubled over the past decade, the fuel is not currently playing a decisive role in the country’s strategy to tackle climate chan...",
