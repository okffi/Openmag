Heat pumps took centre-stage in the UK government’s recent “ warm homes plan ”, which said that they could also help cut household energy bills by “hundreds of pounds” a year. Similarly, innovation agency Nesta estimates that typical households could cut their annual energy bills nearly £300 a year, by switching from a gas boiler to a heat pump. Yet ther...",
