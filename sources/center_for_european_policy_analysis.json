In 1996, the owner of a Seattle real estate magazine, Ken Zeran, sued AOL after anonymous users linked him to T-shirts trivializing the&nbsp; tragic bombing&nbsp; of an Oklahoma City government building. A US federal court&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; for AOL, reasoning that the authors, not the platform, were responsible.&nbsp; The US Code&nbsp; Section 230 &nbsp;of the Communications Decency Act, signed into law on February 8, 1996, codified that ruling i...",

The program was broadcast shortly before the February 6 shooting of the GRU’s deputy head at his ...",
