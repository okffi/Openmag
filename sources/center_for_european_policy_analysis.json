France’s Aurore Lalucq, one of the European Parliament’s leading voices on financial services, recently expressed fears that Washington might suddenly “cut off” Europe.” Europe must build an alternative, “an Airbus of payment systems,” she said, America’s dominance of global payments is not accidental: it grew around private card ne...",

After accusing governments of suppressing free speech, the chatbot restricted its image-generation function. There are le...",

    "content": "Russia is fighting two wars at once: a brutal war in Ukraine and a persistent hybrid war across the European continent. That gray-zone conflict increasingly uses the air, space, and cyber domains — along with criminals and biker gangs — to probe, destabilize, and undermine European resolve. If and when a peace deal is finalized, this pressure will not cease; it will intensify. Western capitals must therefore prepare for the war after the war, especially since any post-ceasefire force is likely t...",

With the Trump administration making clear through statements and policy papers that Europe is very largely on its own, the continent’s bigger powers are facing deeply uncomfortable choices. That’s especially true for Italy, where a populist, right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has sought to be a bridge to Donald Trump, with whom she enjoys goo...",

The key Korean advantage centers on high-performance memory chips.

AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT have a voracious appetite for cutting-edge memory, which speed up connections with NVIDIA and AMD chips. High-Bandwidth...",
