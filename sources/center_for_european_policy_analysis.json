    "content": "Russia is fighting two wars at once: a brutal war in Ukraine and a persistent hybrid war across the European continent. That gray-zone conflict increasingly uses the air, space, and cyber domains — along with criminals and biker gangs — to probe, destabilize, and undermine European resolve. If and when a peace deal is finalized, this pressure will not cease; it will intensify. Western capitals must therefore prepare for the war&nbsp;after&nbsp;the war, especially since any post-ceasefire force i...",

With the Trump administration making clear through statements and policy papers that Europe is very largely on its own, the continent’s bigger powers are facing deeply uncomfortable choices. That’s especially true for Italy, where a populist, right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has sought to be a bridge to Donald Trump, with whom she enjoys goo...",
