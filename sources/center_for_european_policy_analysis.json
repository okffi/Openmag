Canada’s Mark Carney calls it a “rupture,” and that doesn’t seem too far from the truth. The current American administration says it hopes to save Europe from itself , from the risk that mass immigration will cause “civilizational erasure.” Its initial intention was to support MAGA-inclined parties across Eu",
