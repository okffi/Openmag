The enormous burden of the fighting and the death toll has been disproportionately borne by the peoples of the poorest and most remote parts of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.thebell.io/waging-war-with-the-poor/\">New analysis by <em>The Bell</em></a> shows that the human cost of the invasion falls overwhelmingly on impoverished regions and minorities, and that this burden will only grow as the economy deteriorates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has framed the war as a shared national trial. Early on, Putin cited the heroism of Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov, a Lak from Dagestan, and other soldiers to say: “I am a Lak, I am Dagest</p></body></html>",

In the US and other post-conflict societies, veteran reintegration has long been understood as a core social policy issue rather than a narrow welfare concern.
