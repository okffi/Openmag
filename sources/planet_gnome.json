I knew the theory here but I had never looked into the mechanism. Today’s post is a quick overview of how it’s done. allocation sites In a JavaScript program, there are a number of source code locations that allocate.

This usually isn’t much of an issue but it breaks down in two cases: If the driver depends on a specific kernel version If the runtime is end-of-life (EOL) The first issue is what the proprietary Nvidia drivers exhibit. A specific user space driver requires a specific kernel driver. For drivers in Mesa, this isn’t an issue. In the medium term, we might get lucky h...",
