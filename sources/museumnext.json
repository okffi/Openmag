    "content": "Here’s a thought experiment: What if your museum handed over its TikTok account to a bunch of teenagers—no filters, no approvals, just… full access? If your heart just skipped a beat, you’re not alone. Most cultural institutions would call that a PR risk. But at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, it’s business as usual. In fact, it’s part of a radical (and remarkably successful) strategy for youth engagement that’s been quietly reshaping the museum from the inside out. At the Museums &amp; Publi...",

But for some people, traditional museum visits can feel overwhelming—the crowds, bright lights, and background noise can turn what should be a calming experience into a stressful one. To address this, many museums are introducing &#8216;Quiet Hours&#8217; or &#8216;Quiet Visits.&#8217; These dedicated periods provide a calmer, more sensory-friendly en...",

Her argument is simple: heritage is not just backwards-facing. It is a lens for making sense of the present and a surprising launchpad for young people imagining thei...",
