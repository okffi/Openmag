This scheme is dedicated to – and open only for – the DARIAH Working Groups, and is intended to support their activities, small-scale projects and innovative ideas to be put forward, implemented, or sustained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this call, which was launched in September and was closed in mid November 2025, we received 8 applications overall. The evaluation of these applications was carried out by two reviewers for each proposal, concluding to a reviewers’ meeting in which the winning proposals were agreed among the whole evaluation committee as well as the Board of Directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, DARIAH awarded 7 WGs</p></body></html>",
