    "content": "Last week, the OLG Hamburg provided the first genuinely substantive judicial engagement with what constitutes a machine-readable rights reservation under Article 4(3) of the DSM Directive in an AI context. While EU courts have so far been consistent in treating the use of copyrighted works for AI training as a form of text and data mining, the question of how rightholders can validly opt out of the general TDM exception has largely remained underdeveloped. Until now, references to “machine reada...",

Much of the attention has focused on changes to core concepts underpinning the data protection and ePrivacy frameworks, which would have far-reaching consequences for the protection of fundamental rights . But while most of the pushback has focused on these p...",

What we have not seen, however— and despite the clear obligation in Article 53(1)(d) of the AI Act — are any meaningful public summaries of the data used to train these models.
