No longer primarily a regulatory or ethical challenge, the Commission President positioned AI as an economic and geopolitical opportunity. Central to the vision presented in Paris was a significant increase in public investment in AI and an infrastructural build-out captured by the idea of “AI Gigafactories”.</p>\n<p>The industrial ambition was underscored by a headline figure: a commitment to mobilize €200 billion for AI investment in Europe. The amount combined a €150 billion pledge from the <a href=\"https://aichampions.eu/\">European AI Champions Initiative</a>, with a €50 billion contribution</p></body></html>",
