It’s considered to be the most important art fair in the world, and for many in the cultural sector, it’s one of the most eagerly awaited events in the annual calendar – not only as a commercial space for expensive works, but also as an industry gathering, a spectacle, a temporary museum with a catwalk, and a marathon of parties. For others, the whole thing feels rather exhausting and overcrowded, a place where art is openly traded as a commodity and loses some of its aura. The Finnish collector Timo Miettinen recently said <a href=\"https://www.monopol-magazin.de/interview-timo-miettinen\">in an interview with the magazine <em>Monopol</em></a> that he doesn’t particularly like art fairs and has only been to Art Basel twice in hi</p></body></html>",

I met people. I heard life stories. And sometimes people, especially women, would show me their scars.
