You really have to understand that, because it wasn’t easy making Jed (the dog/wolf) such an integral part of the film, which was just inducted into the<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/?loclr=blogloc\"> National Film Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>As everyone who saw John Carpenter’s 1982 sci-fi/horror classic knows, Jed was kind of a big deal. Like fellow star Keith David, it was his first major role! He opens the movie!</p>\n<p>But he’s not the cute canine he appears to be when he shows up at the frozen research station in Antarctica where Kurt Russell and pals are swillin’ Scotch and doing a little science.
