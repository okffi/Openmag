    "content": "CIVICUS, a global civil society alliance, calls on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the international community to step up and do more to resolve the human rights crisis in Myanmar as well as reject the sham election results. Five years after the 1 February 2021 coup, there has been a serious failure to take effective action to deter the ongoing repression of activists in the country, attacks on civilians by the junta, and to restore democracy and civilian rule.",
