The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls for a shift from post‑disaster rebuilding to proactive, climate‑resilient infrastructure. ADB urges governments to integrate climate risk into infrastructure policy and financing while expanding resilience bonds, blended finance, and adopting nature‑based solutions. It argues that resilient, risk‑informed design protects growth and stability, making infra</p></div></div></div></body></html>",
