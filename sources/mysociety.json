    "content": "As we&#8217;ve seen in our recent case studies, the Council Climate Action Scorecards — a joint project between Climate Emergency UK (CE UK) and mySociety — rely on the power and energy of volunteers. Most volunteers get their start when they help to mark councils&#8217; climate action for the Scorecards; and then some, it seems, get the bug and go on to become even more deeply engaged. These keen folk are known as Ambassadors. We&#8217;ve heard from Lucy , who told us that working with the Scor...",
