Quick responses to quieten rumours or accept responsibility for missteps are crucial.</p>\n\n<p>This becomes challenging when people themselves are the brand. Their behaviour is much harder to control than a press release. They present feelings and emotions that may disrupt any strategic response to scandal. </p>\n\n<p>Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19632wx\">royal family</a> is a case in point – and with the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, their brand is facing one of its biggest tests of the modern age.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers are known to form </p></body></html>",
