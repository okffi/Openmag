    "content": "For centuries, people have fantasized about playing God by creating artificial versions of human beings. This is a dream reinvented with every breaking wave of new technology.

Throughout the world, and especially in the West, an anti-political mood has taken hold.&nbsp; Faith in several key national institutions is at an all-time low in the U.S. To many voters, political outsiders are more compelling than experienced politicians. Anger toward elites is commonplace as income inequality rises. The social climate is growing lonelier and more frayed. Commun...",

But turn off a gravel road near the Cedar River in the rural southeast and walk through an ornate rusted arch, and you will find yourself in another world. Rochester Cemetery is not just an active cemetery. It’s a remnant of a once-common sight in Iowa, the place where tallgrass prairie a...",

In this circumstance, there is not so much a vacuum as a cloud of uncertainty. Everything is up in the air. Expectations, assumptions and intentions are scrambled. Fearing lost advantage in the face of these unknowns, worst-case scenarios drive the build-out of capabilities.
