    "content": "While in graduate school and mulling relationship problems, Marc Berman did something that felt faintly ludicrous: He walked up to an oak tree and started talking to it. The grandeur of this oak, in Ann Arbor’s Nichols Arboretum, seized Berman. It was strikingly large and isolated from the rest. “I’m a scientist, so I don’t know if I really believe in this stuff, but it had this aura about it,” he recalled. “There was something very powerful about that tree.” Berman thought about previous awe-in...",

When his own government refused to grant him mining licenses for iron and coal because of concerns about carbon emissions, he sued them repeatedly, seeking a total of roughly $400 billion in lost profits. When that failed, he used a legal loophole — transferring assets to a firm of his based in Singapore — to make his case for financial compensation as a foreign investor using an internati...",
