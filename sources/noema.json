Aboard, three technicians get to work attaching weighted plastic containers called Niskin bottles to a cable. The cable drops the bottles 60 meters into the Atlantic Ocean. More bottles follow like pearls on a string: 30 meters, 10, five, one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n</div>\n\n\n<p>Once the bottles are full of seawater, they’re hauled back to the surface, where the technicians begin to decant their contents, working quickly in the cold but getting slightly soaked in the process. Some of the water is directed into glass vials and mixed with chemicals to test for dissolved oxygen; other samples are processe</p></body></html>",
