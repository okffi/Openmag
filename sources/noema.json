The venture capital fund-meets-ideas lab incubated well-known companies across a range of industries, like DoorDash, Coinbase, Airbnb, Instacart, Reddit and Gusto. Then, in August 2024, it diverged from its consumer-facing portfolio and, for the first time in its history, underwrote the weapons company Ares Industries. The El Segundo,...",

    "content": "When the United States summarily defected from the world order it had built since the end of World War II, effectively joining the revisionist powers of China and Russia, it was clear we were headed back to the kind of Great Power spheres of influence that characterized the 19th century. What was less clear was how all those left out of this equation would fare going forward. In the most powerful speech delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, Canadian Prime Minist...",

Typing “lasagna recipe ideas” into Google used to surface a litany of food blogs, each with its own story: a grandmother’s family variation, step-by-step photos of ingredients laid out on a wooden table, videos showing technique and a long comment section where readers debated substitutions or shared their own tweaks.

It practices the subtle art of pressing nigiri into form inside its neural network, watching rice grains yield to its grip. It rotates its wrist 10,000 times in an attempt to keep the nori taut around a maki roll. Each failure teaches it something about the dynamics of the world. When its aluminum fingers finally touch rice grains, it already knows how much pressure they can bear. This is the promise of world models ....",

As the MIT economist has written in Noema , the capacity of mid-level professions such as nursing, design or production management to access greater expertise and knowledge once available only to doctors or specialists will boost the “applicable” value of their labor, and thus the wages and salaries that can sustain a middle class. Unlike rote, low-level clerical work, cognitive labor of this sort is more likely t...",

With genetic engineering came the prospect of human cloning, and with robotics that of humanlike androids. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is another breaking wave — potentially a tsunami. The AI systems we have around us are arguably already intelligent, at least in some ways. They will surely get smarter still. ...",
