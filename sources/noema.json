    "content": "For nearly two decades, the highly selective startup accelerator Y Combinator (YC) kick-started what would become some of the most popular apps on your smartphone.

    "content": "When the United States summarily defected from the world order it had built since the end of World War II, effectively joining the revisionist powers of China and Russia, it was clear we were headed back to the kind of Great Power spheres of influence that characterized the 19th century. What was less clear was how all those left out of this equation would fare going forward.

Typing “lasagna recipe ideas” into Google used to surface a litany of food blogs, each with its own story: a grandmother’s family variation, step-by-step photos of ingredients laid out on a wooden table, videos showing technique and a long comment section where readers debated substitutions or shared their own tweaks.
