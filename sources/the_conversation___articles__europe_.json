Four majestic lions in the colours of Olympique Lyonnais stand proudly in front of the stadium, symbols of the influence of a club that dominated French football in the early 2000s. The lion is everywhere in the club’s branding: on the logo, on social media, and even on the chests of some fans who live and breathe for their team. These are the ones who rise as one when <a href=\"https://www.sportbuzzbusiness.fr/olympique-lyonnais-nouvelle-mascotte-lyou-concue-par-popcorn-live.html\">Lyou, the mascot</a>, runs through the stands every time the team scores a goal.
